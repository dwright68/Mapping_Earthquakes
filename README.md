# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to map any earthquakes in the world that have occurred within the last 7 days. This will be accomplished using the following tools: 
 - [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html)
 - [Mapbox API](https://www.mapbox.com/)
 - [Earthquake Data Provided by the US Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/)

This project maps any recent earthquakes as well as the tectonic plates lines. See example image below:
